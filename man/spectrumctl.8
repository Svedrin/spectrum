.TH spectrumctl 8  "February 21, 2010" "Version 0.1\-git" "Spectrum Manual"
.SH NAME
spectrumctl \- util to control spectrum instances
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B spectrumctl
[options] operation
.SH DESCRIPTION
spectrumctl is a small tool written in python which can be used to control instances of the spectrum XMPP transport.
spectrum only handles one legacy network per instance, so you need more than one spectrum instance if you want support for more than one legacy network.
By default, spectrumctl acts on all transports defined in \fI/etc/spectrum/\fR.
