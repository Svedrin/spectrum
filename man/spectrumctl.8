.SH NAME
spectrumctl \- Utility to control one or more spectrum instances
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B spectrumctl
[options] operation
.SH DESCRIPTION
spectrumctl is a tool that can be used to control instances of the spectrum XMPP
transport. spectrum only handles one legacy network per instance, so you need
more than one spectrum instance if you want support for more than one legacy
network. By default, spectrumctl acts on all transports defined in 
\fI/etc/spectrum/\fR. The tool offers standard tasks usually performed by
initscripts but also enables some runtime configuration of spectrum instances.
.sp
An interactive shell with comfortable tab-completion is also supported to help
with more complex administration tasks. See the \fBSHELL\fR for a detailed
explanation.
.SH OPERATIONS
.PP
\fBstart\fR, \fBstop\fR, \fBrestart\fR
.RS 4
Start, stop or restart given spectrum instances (all of them per default).
.sp
.RE
\fBlist\fR
.RS 4
Show a list of spectrum configurations (and their corresponding instances with PID if running)
.sp
.RE
\fBreload\fR
.RS 4
Reload given spectrum configurations. This just causes spectrum to reopen its
log-files, it does not change any runtime configuration.
.sp
.RE
\fBstats\fR
.RS 4
Print current usage statistics. \fBNote:\fR This option requires the xmpppy library for
python.
.sp
.RE
\fBset-vip-status \fIuser\fR \fIstatus\fR
.RS 4
Set the VIP status of \fIuser\fR, \fIstatus\fR must be either \fB0\fR (disable
VIP status) or \fB1\fR (enable VIP status).
.sp
.RE
\fBregister \fIjid\fR \fIusername\fR
.RS 4
Register the \fIjid\fR using \fIusername\fR. The former is the real JID of the
user, the latter his/her username in the legacy network. Unlike all other
commands, this command is interactive: It will ask you for the password of the
users legacy network account. Of course this command only makes sense if you specify a single
transport using \fI--config\fR.
.sp
.RE
\fBunregister \fIjid\fR
.RS 4
Unregister the user with JID \fIjid\fR. Unlike the \fBregister\fR command, it
makes sense to use this command with multiple transports, because this will
unregister a user on all transports he uses.
.sp
.RE
\fBhelp\fR
.RS 4
Show the help message, alias for \fI\-\-help\fR.
.SH OPTIONS
.RE
\fB\-c\fR \fIFILE\fR, \fB\-\-config\fR=\fIFILE\fR
.RS 4
Only act on transport configured in FILE (ignored for list)
.sp
.RE
\fB\-d\fR \fIDIR\fR, \fB\-\-config\-dir\fR=\fIDIR\fR
.RS 4
Act on all transports configured in DIR (default: \fI/etc/spectrum\fR)
.sp
.RE
\fB\-q\fR, \fB\-\-quiet\fR
.RS 4
Do not print any output (ignored for list)
.sp
.RE
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
.RS 4
show a help message and exit
.sp
.RE
\fB\-\-version\fR
.RS 4
show program's version number and exit
.RE
.sp
.RE
Options for action "\fBlist\fR":
.sp
.RS 4
\fB\-\-status\fR=\fISTATUS\fR
.RS 4
Only show transports with given status. Valid values are "\fIrunning\fR", "\fIstopped\fR" and "\fIunknown\fR"
.sp
.RE
\fB\-\-machine-readable\fR
.RS 4
Output data as comma-seperated values.
.sp
.RE
.RE
Options for action "\fBstart\fR":
.sp
.RS 4
\fB\-\-su\fR=\fISU\fR
.RS 4
Start spectrum as this user (default: \fIspectrum\fR). Overrides the SPECTRUM_USER environment variable.
If neither --su nor SPECTRUM_USER is specified, the user defaults to 
\fIspectrum\fR.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-no-daemon\fR
.RS 4
Do not start spectrum as daemon.
.sp
.RE
\fB\-\-debug\fR
.RS 4
Start spectrum in debug mode. Currently this just sets the maximum size of the
core files to unlimited.
.RE
.SH ENVIRONMENT
The behaviour of spectrumctl can be influenced by the following environment variables:
.sp
\fBSPECTRUM_PATH\fR
.RS 4
Path where the spectrum binary is located. If omitted, spectrum is assumed to be in your PATH.
.RE
.sp
\fBSPECTRUM_USER\fR
.RS 4
The user with which spectrum is started. Overridden by the --su command line
option. 
If neither --su nor SPECTRUM_USER is specified, the user defaults to 
\fIspectrum\fR.
