# This is a configuration file for /etc/init.d/spectrum; it allows you to
# perform common modifications to the behavior of the spectrum daemon
# startup without editing the init script (and thus getting prompted
# by dpkg on upgrades).  We all love dpkg prompts. Note that changes here
# affect all spectrum instances.

# If you want to run spectrum as a different user, you can specify it here:
#SPECTRUM_USER=spectrum

# If you want to override the spectrum binary with something like a wrapper
# script, you can do that here:
#SPECTRUM_PATH=/usr/local/bin/spectrum-wrapper
