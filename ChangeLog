	* Try to reconnect to Jabber server for all stream errors.
	* Disconnect users from legacy network when Jabber server gets down.
	* Fixed timestamps for delayed messages from legacy network.
	* Entity capabilities hash is now computed correctly.
	* transport_features and vip_features config variables are depracted now.
	  Use [features] and [vip-features] sections instead of them. See default
	  spectrum.cfg for more details and example.

	ICQ/AIM:

	General:
	* Don't answer error IQ stanza on disco#info request.
	* Added Windows compilation support.
	* Send unavailable presences when shutting transport down.
	* Working filetransfer from XMPP to legacy network when legacy network user
	  can't receive file. File is then stored on server and the link to file is
	  sent. Web address and file storage directory can be set in config file.
	* Twitter protocol support (using http://code.google.com/p/prpltwtr/)
	* Added $filename:jid, $filename:protocol and $filename:port config variables
	  which are set according to config filename. It has to be named as
	  jid:protocol:port.cfg (for example icq.localhost:icq:5432.cfg).
	* Fixed crash when legacy network user cancels filetransfer.
	* Fixed crash when XMPP user cancels Adhoc command execution.
	* Fixed crash when two XMPP users try to use one legacy network account.
	* Don't send duplicate presences.
	* Don't forward typing notification without an existing conversation.
	* Fixed transport unregister process. Buddies are now removed also if user
	  doesn't support Roster Item Exchange.
	* Forward VCard avatars from XMPP to legacy network, with the caveat that
	  this only works if the VCard avatar adheres to the file type, size,
	  and dimension constraints of the legacy network (no scaling is currently
	  done).
	* Added filetransfer_bind_address and filetransfer_public_address config
	  variables to be able to set IP and port for filetransfer proxy.  The
	  public address is used if Spectrum is behind a NAT.
	* Spectrum can now open a local socket that allows (fast) statistics
	  gathering. This is already used by spectrumctl. The path to the
	  local socket is configured with the config_interface option.
	* New man pages for spectrum.cfg and spectrumctl.

	spectrumctl:
	* The script now does rigorous checking of ownership and permissions
	  on all the important files and directories.
	* New action "stats" which gathers statistics via the config_interface
	  (see above).
	* Two new command-line options for start: 
	  * --no-daemon: Do not start spectrum as a daemon
	  * --debug: Sets some environment variables, a coredump will be made
	    to $HOME in case of a segfault.
	* New command-line option for list: 
	  * --machine-readable: Output data as comma-seperated values
	* env-variable SPECTRUM_PATH can now configure how spectrumctl is
	  called. If the variable is not set, it assumes that spectrum is in its
	  PATH.
	* env-variable SPECTRUM_USER can now configure the name of the
	  spectrum-user. This is still overridden by --su.

	XMPP:
	* MUC support for XMPP

	IRC:
	* IRC Nickserv password can be set via Adhoc command.
	* Fixed Private Messages.
	* Using IRC Helper (http://plugins.guifications.org/trac/wiki/irchelper) for
	  identyfing user. Used only if IRC Helper is installed.

	Munin plugin
	* Now use config_interface instead of XMPP-connection. This changes
	  the configuraton significantly, please see documentation of the
	  plugin for details.
