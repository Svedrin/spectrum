	General:
	* Don't answer twice to disco#items stanzas.
	* Fixed memory corruption in SpectrumTimer.

	  much more faster especially with SQLite).
	* Better subscriptions handling. Fixes the bug when accepting buddies with
	  capital letters or spaces.
	* Fixed disconnecting the rooms.

	Twitter:
	* Twitter is going to stop basic authentication support. Old Prpltwtr
	  plugin doesn't support new OAuth authentication, therefore Spectrum
	  needs microblog-purple <http://code.google.com/p/microblog-purple/>
	  since this release. Read Upgrade Notes:
	  <http://spectrum.im/projects/spectrum/wiki/UpgradeNotes>.
	* Before first connection, Spectrum asks user to allow it access to his
	  Twitter account. User has to open the link in web-browser and send
	  the PIN back to Spectrum.
	* Passwords are not stored on the server now.
	* #home MUC room doesn't work.

	XMPP:
	* Fixed crash in AdHoc commands.

	Identica:
	* Added support for Identica - needs microblog-purple
	  <http://code.google.com/p/microblog-purple/>.

	* Added support for HoN network - needs honpurpl
	  <http://code.google.com/p/honpurple/>.

	spectrumctl:
	* --quiet is no longer ignored by list action:
	  Only print not running transports and no header-line
	* --cron allows you to run spectrumctl --cron list for periodic
	  cron jobs: Only print crashed transports ("Dead but pid-file
	  exists") and remove the pid file afterwards.

	  and dimension constraints of the legacy network (no scaling is currently
	  done).
	* Added filetransfer_bind_address and filetransfer_public_address config
	  variables to be able to set IP and port for filetransfer proxy.  The
	  public address is used if Spectrum is behind a NAT.
	* Spectrum can now open a local socket that allows (fast) statistics
