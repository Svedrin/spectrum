=== Things we want for a 0.3 release ===
* Ad-Hoc commands:
  ejabberd has quite a few usefull adhoc commands. Here is what could be useful
  for spectrum:
  * list all (online) users
  * send a message to all (online) users
  These features could also be accessable via config_interface and spectrumctl.
* Make it possible to delete old unused accounts. 
  

=== Things that should happen at some point ===
* Translating avatars from XMPP->legacy needs to respect the
  PurplePluginProtocolInfo::icon_spec format and size restrictions.
